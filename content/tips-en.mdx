## Local Tips From Byron

- **Taxis:** Use inDriver or WhatsApp local drivers â€” they're cheaper than Uber.
- **Groceries:** Super 99 and Riba Smith in Coronado are clean and well-stocked. Riba Smith has more imported goods.
- **Beach:** El Palmar is a short walk and good for beginner surfers. Playa Serena is quieter.
- **Restaurants:** Nazca 21 for ceviche, La Ruina for pizza, and Luna Rossa for Italian.
- **Water:** Tap water is safe, but filtered water is provided for taste.
- **Sun & Bugs:** Bring sunscreen and bug spray, especially at dusk.
