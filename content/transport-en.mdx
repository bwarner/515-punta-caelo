## Bus

In the Punta Caelo community near Coronado in Panamá Oeste,
local transportation is primarily served by air-conditioned coaster-style minibuses that run frequent routes
between surrounding neighborhoods, beaches, and San Carlos. The [L041](https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-line-l041-Panam%C3%A1-4674-1799010-27147736-0) “Coronado Interno” route loops through Coronado, starting at Avenida Eisenmann & Punta Prieta—roughly every 14 minutes on weekdays (≈ every 18–24 minutes weekends), from about 5:20 AM to 10:20 PM, completing a full circuit in ~33 minutes

The [Moovit app](https://moovitapp.com) offers a printable schedule and route map for buses throughout Panama

## Taxi & Uber

Uber operates in the Coronado and San Carlos area, but availability can be limited, especially during off-peak hours or farther from the main road. Wait times may vary, so we recommend checking the Uber app early or during busier parts of the day.

Taxis are an alternative. They do not use meters, so always agree on a price before getting in. For local trips around San Carlos or Coronado, fares usually range from $2–$5, while longer trips (e.g., to Panama City or El Valle) will be more.
